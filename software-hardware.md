### Operating System
The first requirement for the neural network is the operating system
here we are using ubuntu 18.04 for codeing and testing and windows 10 for
training the model. the opensource nature of the linux os will give us more
room for us to see the underlying process but the windows is the main operating system
that we are using to train the network because it has the direct access to the
graphics card for using it to train the model

### Framework
We are not using any framework in the ubuntu 18.04 operating system to program
except the atom text editor which is used to write the code and find the syntax error.
But in windows 10 we are using anaconda to access the spyder IDE to train the
model and get the output.

### Version Controle
We are using Git for the version control and using Github for the cloud version
control for tranfering the updated code from testing environment to the training
environment and also for having the right version to train after many versions
of testing

### Virtual Mechine
We are using the VirtualBox to run the Virtual machines. We are using ubuntu 18.04
in the VirtualBox for the testing environment

## Hardware

### CPU
For this traing we are using a intel 7th gen kaby lake unlocked processor i7-7700k
for the testing environment since it used under the virtual mechine it can only access
the CPU so the CPU needs to be a powerful one to test the neural network

### GPU
For the model training we are using one of the good graphics card GTX 1080ti
it has 11GB of Graphical processing memory and 3584 CUDA cores in the system
the need for the graphics card is that it can do sequential numerical processing
at a higher rate than the CPU. The higher the CUDA core amount and the Graphics card
memory the more the numerial calculation it can do.
